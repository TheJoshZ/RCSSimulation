# Reaction Control System (RCS) Simulation

## 1.0 Introduction
This is a Reaction Control System (RCS) simulation I built, inspired by a similar system found in the game *Kerbal Space Program*. The project was completed in prior years, and I am now uploading it to GitHub as a showcase. 

The project consists of two phases:
1. **Software Phase**
2. **Hardware Phase**

This simulation models a rigid body controlled by six thrusters positioned around each side of a cube (simulated rigid body). Through various thruster actuations, the system achieves:
- **Rotation** around the three axes.
- **Translation** along the three axes.

## 2.0 Physics
Translational motion and rotational motion can be achieved via actuation shown on the diagram below:
